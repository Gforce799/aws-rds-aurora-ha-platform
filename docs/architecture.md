# Architecture Notes

    ## Context

    A highly available Aurora PostgreSQL platform with private subnet placement, KMS encryption, Secrets Manager credential storage, deletion protection, backup retention, and CloudWatch alarms.

    ## Design principles

    - Secure-by-default resources with explicit escape hatches.
    - Independent environments through variables and naming.
    - Operational visibility through logs, alarms, or managed service telemetry.
    - Review-friendly Terraform that separates inputs, outputs, and resources.

    ## Deployment model

    The root module can be consumed directly or wrapped by an environment layer
    such as Terragrunt, Terraform Cloud, or a central platform pipeline. In a
    production organization, backend configuration should be provided outside
    the module so the same code can serve multiple accounts.

    ## Risks and trade-offs

    - Some AWS services require account-level enablement or service-linked roles.
- Defaults optimize for safe demonstration, not lowest cost.
    - Networking, identity, and logging controls should be integrated with the
      target organization's landing zone before production use.
